## Features
This game allows two players to enjoy the traditional "Snakes and Ladders" experience. Players take turns by pressing any key, which triggers a dice roll. The dice roll is simulated with a random function

which advance the player upwards with a victory sound, and snakes, which move the player downwards with a losing sound. The game continuously updates the board to display the current positions of the players. 
When a player reaches the 99th position, the game declares them the winner and resets for a new game.
